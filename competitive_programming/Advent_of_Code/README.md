# üéÑ Advent of Code üéÅ
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other. [More info](https://adventofcode.com/about)

## Informations
For each edition I create a new folder with name `YYYY`, where YYYY is a specific year.
For each puzzle, there is a directory `YYYY/Day DD`, where DD is number of the day.
